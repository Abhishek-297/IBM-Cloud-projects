## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project is part of my **AICTE-IBM SkillsBuild Internship** under **Edunet Foundation**, where I built a **No-Code Agentic AI solution** using **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio** and **IBM Cloud services**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI-driven solutions can simplify personalized learning experiences through **Agentic AI workflows** and **cloud-based deployment without coding**. 

While working on this project, I also explored advanced AI concepts such as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **AutoAI for Machine Learning Automation** as part of my internship learning curriculum.
